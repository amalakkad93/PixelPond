 Post Management


3. Album Management
Once posts are manageable, proceed with the Album model. Albums will likely contain posts, so it makes sense to develop this feature after posts. Implement functionality for users to create albums, add posts to albums, and manage these albums (view, update, delete).

4. Comment System
With posts and albums in place, you can then add the ability for users to comment on posts using the Comment model. Implement features for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting comments on posts.
